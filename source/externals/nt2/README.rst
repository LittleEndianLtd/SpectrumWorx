About **NT**:sup:`2`
--------------------
The **Numerical Template Toolbox** (**NT**:sup:`2`) is an Open Source C++ library
aimed at simplifying the development, debugging and optimization of high-performance
computing applications by providing a **Matlab** like syntax that eases the transition
between prototype and actual application.

So What is This About?
:::::::::::::::::::::::
Did you ever want to use your multi-core machines to their fullest extent or to take
advantage of your processor's SIMD extensions but never did because of the
steep learning curve? By pushing the limits of the C++ language, **NT**:sup:`2`
uses template meta-programming to its fullest and automatizes these tasks. Reaping
the reward of parallelism has never been so easy and straightforward. Performance
of **NT**:sup:`2` code is on the par with hand-written, optimized C code while
keeping a high level of abstraction.
