[chapter A 5mn Introduction to NT2
  [quickbook 1.5]
]

[section Objective]
This chapter will give you a short overview of how to use __NT2__ through a
short example covering __NT2__ Containers, sample operations and how to
build a __NT2__ application either with [@http://cmake.org CMake] or manually.
Depending on your background, two options are available. If you are a C++ user,
read up the [link a_5mn_introduction_to_nt2.the_c_____nt2____hello_world_ C++ tutorial].
If you are a Matlab user, read up the
[link a_5mn_introduction_to_nt2.a_matlab_to___nt2___introduction Matlab to __NT2__ tutorial]
In both tutorials, we consider that you have a properly installed version of
__NT2__ and a C++ compiler.
