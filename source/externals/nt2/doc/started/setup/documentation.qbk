[section Building __NT2__ Documentation]

Note the latest documentation is always available on the [@http://nt2.metascale.org/doc/html __NT2__ MetaScale website].

For its documentation, __NT2__ uses __BOOSTBOOK__ and the associated toolchain.
You need all the following to be able to build the __NT2__ documentation:

* __DOXYGEN__
* Graphviz
* xsltproc
* Docbook
* __BOOSTBOOK__
* __QUICKBOOK__

On a Debian-based system, the easiest way to install the first four is to install
the following packages:

``
doxygen graphviz xsltproc docbook-xsl
``

The build system is currently hardcoded to look for __BOOSTBOOK__ in =BOOST_ROOT=. __BOOSTBOOK__ comes
with any package of __BOOST__, release or trunk. __QUICKBOOK__, on the other hand, needs to be built manually,
using for example the following set of commands:

``
cd $BOOST_ROOT
./bootstrap.sh
cd tools/quickbook
../../b2 -j4
``
