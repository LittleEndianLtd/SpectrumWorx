[section Downloading __NT2__]
The pre-built binary package is the easiest way to retrieve __NT2__. You can
download them from [@https://github.com/MetaScale/nt2/downloads our Downloads page].

Once downloaded, just decompress the files to location path of you choice. We
will refer to this location as the *download directory* in the following sections.

[section Package Structure]
The binary distribution, on top of providing the libraries in a built binary
form, also contains files that are automatically generated when the build system
is configured, and has all module-specific files flattened into a module-less
tree. The __NT2__ download directory should then look like:

``
nt2/
|-- cmake/
|-- doc/
|-- include/
|-- lib/
|-- modules/
|-- tools/
``

Those folders contain:

* =nt2/cmake=: __CMAKE__ modules for __NT2__ usage, directory suitable to add
  to your `CMAKE_MODULE_PATH`
* =nt2/doc=: __NT2__ HTML documentation
* =nt2/include=: __NT2__ headers, directory suitable to add to your include path
* =nt2/lib=: __NT2__ library binaries, directory suitable to add to your linker path
* =nt2/modules=: Files used by __NT2__ to identity installed modules
* =nt2/tools=: Programs that are used to manage a __NT2__ setup

Once extracted, you just have to copy the whole =nt2= folder to a location of
your choice.
