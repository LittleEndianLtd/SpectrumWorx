[section Structure of a Module]

`TODO REFURBISH PROPERLY WITH NEW CONTENTS`

* Miss cmake, doc, src, unit, examples etc...
* Give a short description of the minimalist module to be able to make new ones
* Special CMake consideration when your module has sources, must copy files etc...

Under the hood, any given Module is laid out as follows:

[table Module layout
    [[Path]  [Description]]
    [[[^nt2/toolbox/[~toolbox-name]`/functions`/[~function-name].hpp]]
    [Defines function [~function-name] as a template forwarding to future Boost.Dispatch specializations.]]
    [[[^nt2/toolbox/[~toolbox-name]`/functions`/[~some-path]/[~function-name].hpp]]
    [Defines a specialization for the function [~function-name]. [~some-path] may not contain
    the directories =details=, =detail= or =impl=, and should reflect the kind of specialization
    involved.]]
    [[[^nt2/toolbox/[~toolbox-name]`/constant`/[~constant-name].hpp]]
    [Defines constant [~constant-name] as a template forwarding to future Boost.Dispatch specializations.]]
    [[[^nt2/toolbox/[~toolbox-name]`/constant`/[~some-path]/[~function-name].hpp]]
    [Defines a specialization for the constant [~constant-name]. [~some-path] may not contain
    the directories =details=, =detail= or =impl=, and should reflect the kind of specialization
    involved.]]
]

The gathering of include files happens *after* all modules have been loaded, which means specializations from other
modules still get included.
