[section Functions]

Functions and/or constants are grouped together into *toolboxes*
according to a single /theme/: arithmetic, trigonometric, linear algebra,
signal processing...

All toolbox constants and functions use the
[@http://svn.boost.org/svn/boost/sandbox/SOC/2011/simd/doc/html/dispatch.html Boost.Dispatch]
system so that it is possible to specialize functions and constants on categories of types.

The layout of toolbox headers is as follows:
[table Toolbox layout
    [[Path]  [Description]]
    [[[^nt2/toolbox/[~toolbox-name].hpp]] [Includes the whole toolbox [~toolbox-name]]]
    [[[^nt2/toolbox/[~toolbox-name]/[~toolbox-name].hpp]] [Same as above]]
    [[[^nt2/toolbox/[~toolbox-name]/functions.hpp]] [Includes all functions defined in toolbox [~toolbox-name]]]
    [[[^nt2/toolbox/[~toolbox-name]/constants.hpp]] [Includes all constants defined in toolbox [~toolbox-name]]]
    [[[^nt2/toolbox/[~toolbox-name]`/include/functions`/[~function-name].hpp]]
    [Includes function [~function-name] as well as all its specializations]]
    [[[^nt2/toolbox/[~toolbox-name]`/include/constants`/[~constant-name].hpp]]
    [Includes constant [~constant-name] as well as all its specializations]]
    [[[^nt2`/include/functions`/[~function-name].hpp]]
    [Includes function [~function-name] as well as all its specializations (sys toolboxes only)]]
    [[[^nt2`/include/constants`/[~constant-name].hpp]]
    [Includes constant [~constant-name] as well as all its specializations (sys toolboxes only)]]
]

Some toolboxes are referred as being /sys/: all their functions are into the nt2
namespace. Other toolboxes introduce their own namespace, i.e. all functions they define are in
a namespace with the same name as the toolbox name (they are referred /usr/:).
