[section Operators]
Operators are functions so useful they got a special status and an infix notation.

__MATLAB__ has two types of operators, elementwise and algebraic ones.
__CPP__ can overload existing operators but not create new ones, so
choices are to be made in __NT2__, for instance:

Will `*`  be used for matlab `*` or `.*` ?

The choice will in fact be linked to semantics.
For instance using __NT2__ `table` which have a tableau semantic,
all operators are by default treated as elementwise and
algebraic operators (when they apply) are replaced by function calls.

However classes can modify the meaning of an operator an the conditions of appliance, `*`,
for instance can have a different semantic with `table`, `matrix` or `polynomials`.

Here we treat of the translation of __MATLAB__ operators on `table` or `expressions`.
