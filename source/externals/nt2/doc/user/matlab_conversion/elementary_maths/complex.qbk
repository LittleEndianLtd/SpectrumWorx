[section Complex]

These are Matlab functions that although defined on real numbers are trivial on them and
get real meaning on the complex field.
In NT2 they all exist.

In NT2 supports three type templates for complex numbers, than can be mixed together

# complex: full two parts complex numbers
# imaginary: pure complex number (real part is null and not stored)
# dry: real number considered as complex (imaginary part is null and not stored)

This allows optimizations in storage and computations.
