[section Overview]
Single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) extensions have been a feature of choice
for processor manufacturers for a couple of decades. Designed to provide significant
accelerations, they require expertise, the use of potentially fragile compiler
support, or vendor-specific libraries to be correctly and successfully exploited.
Boost.SIMD is a C++ template library that aims to give a simple and powerful way
to access the benefits of SIMD extensions without suffering from these problems
by providing standard compliant abstractions.

[warning Boost.SIMD is a library in development and is not part of Boost.]

[h2 Dependencies]
Boost.SIMD depends on the following header-only Boost libraries:

* [link the_boost_dispatch_library Boost.Dispatch]
