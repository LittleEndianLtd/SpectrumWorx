[section Objectives]

Those tutorials will drive you through the general principles of Boost.SIMD:

* using the pack abstraction;
* using operations on pack;
* using pack in generic programming context;
* interaction with standard containers.

[note
For all these tutorials, we will consider the use of a 128 bits wide SIMD
extensions (like SSE or regular Altivec). Depending on your actual architecture,
the output of the various tutorial applications may varies.
