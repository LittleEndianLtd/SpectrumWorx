[library Boost.SIMD Functions and Operators
  [quickbook 1.5]
]

[section Overview]
This module contains all constants, functions and operators available in
Boost.SIMD. They cover:

* [link boost_simd_functions_and_operators.standard_operators standard C++ operators]
* classical mathematic functions
* basic numeric constants like one, zero, factorials, pi, etc...
* predicates over values and types properties
* IEEE 754 specific operations like bit count, mantissa extraction, etc ...
* reduction operations of SIMD registers to scalar value
* internal operations on SIMD register elements

All those functions act as the basic block of all Boost.SIMD functions and are
very interdependent. They are gathered into a single module to reduce complex
dependencies management and simplify access to the core operations of the
library.
