[section Benchmarking with __NT2__]

If correctness is paramount to all computing tasks, the speed at which such
tasks are performed can also be a critical aspect. But the absolute speed of
any program is usually irrelevant as many factor like architecture or data
set can influence such a crude measurement. In order to assess a program
relative performance compared to others, a benchmarking protocol has to be
developped and applied in a systematic, reproductible way.

Being a HPC oriented library, __NT2__ provides a set of functions and classes
to simplify the design of proper benchmarks and the exploitation of their results
by abstracting the system-dependent timers, the choice of the correct metric and
the structure of the benchmark itself.
